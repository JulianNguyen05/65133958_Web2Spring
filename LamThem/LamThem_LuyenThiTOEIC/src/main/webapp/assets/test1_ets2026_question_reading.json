Fortunately, the theater has new owners who have spent the last year updating the interior and the projection system.\n\nChristine Lafferty said that she and her childhood friend Morgan Flanagan spent plenty of time at the theater while growing up. \"Going to the movies is the thing to do on a rainy day in a seaside town.

Unfortunately, the item you requested is on back order. - [1]. If you would prefer not to wait, we have a similar telescope made by another manufacturer, Belter Telescopes. Like the Makatasi model you ordered, the Belter BTR-1483 has a 120 mm aperture and a retractable lens hood. [2]. In addition, all Belter telescopes include a padded carrying case. The Belter BTR-1483 costs $200 less than the Makatasi METX-33948.\n\nIf you wish to revise your order, simply reply to this e-mail within 48 hours or go to our Web site to chat with a representative at http://www.skyviewscopes.com.au. We will then change your order, refund $200 to your credit card, and ship your new telescope overnight at no extra charge. [3]. Otherwise, we will notify you when the Makatasi model METX-33948 is back in stock and provide delivery information at that point. [4].\n\nBest regards,\nDeon Welman\nSales Representative, Skyview Scopes",

Now our customers can enjoy the convenience of frozen food without sacrificing quality.\"\n\nVimalo Brands has partnered with Vancouver-area farms to obtain produce and meat for the Nutridinna line. \"By keeping our operations local, we avoid shipping delays and can flash-freeze freshly harvested vegetables at their peak of ripeness,\" Martens said. \"Our customers benefit further, since our products can be kept in the freezer for up to six months.\"\n\nNutridinna foods will be available in supermarkets beginning in November. Frozen fish and other seafood will be added early next year.",

          "content": "Tips for designing a Web site for a food-truck business\n\nOwners of food trucks move from place to place, within and between cities, as they carry out their business, so they often rely on word of mouth or social media to attract customers. As a result, they may not build a Web site of their own. But in fact, by the very nature of their business, it is crucial that food truck owners have a fixed place for the public to learn about them, order from them, contact them, etc. Furthermore, market research shows that a Web site can help build a loyal customer base. So, here are some tips for developing a great Web site for your food truck.\n\nThe Home page should have bold graphics with your food truck's name. The text must prominently display key information, such as your truck's locations and operating hours. Online forms with fields to fill out, such as reservation requests for special events or services, give new visitors too much visual information. They are better incorporated as links or pop-up windows.\n\nThe Food Menu page needs attractive, high-definition images along with vivid and precise text that describes each menu item in detail. Remember that your photos should be big enough to look appealing on larger computer monitors.\n\nThe About Us page should include some text explaining your food truck's theme and concept, and some biographical data detailing your background in the food industry.\n\nThe News page can include text informing visitors about seasonal food items and upcoming promotions or special events such as food festivals.\n#####\nTo: Doug Abruzzo <dabruzzo@dzacreative.com>\nFrom: Ed Vale <evale@saffronmail.com>\nDate: March 29\nSubject: Feedback\n\nDear Mr. Abruzzo.\n\nThank you again for creating the prototype Web site for my food-truck business. I just wanted to reiterate that it has gotten positive feedback from customers who have tested it. I am so glad we followed the advice in that article you sent me about Web site design for food trucks!\n\nAs we discussed in our phone call yesterday, we will move forward with the prototype Web site and launch it as the official site on April 5. However, I still do not see the information I sent about our new promotion that will begin in mid-April, a free dessert with any sandwich purchase. Please be sure to add this important information before we launch the site.\n\nRegards,\nEd",

It was announced in last month's Daily Gazette that Rilamore University is moving forward with its Net Zero Initiative. Within three years, we expect to have geothermal wells installed and operational for the heating and cooling of our entire campus. Limiting the institution's reliance on fossil fuels has long been a goal, and the new system is a significant step toward achieving that goal.\n\nOver the next month, we will conduct test drilling in several campus locations. If all goes according to schedule, the crew will be drilling adjacent to the Red Hills Business District and Oak Street Apartments starting Wednesday, June 5. We want to tell business owners and residents near the campus to expect a higher-than-usual noise level during the two weeks we estimate it will take to complete the work. The work hours for the drilling crew are 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. each day, Monday through Friday.\n\nWe apologize in advance for the inconvenience this may cause to our neighbors. Any questions or concerns should be directed to me at 813-555-0123.\n\nJohn LaRose\nCommunity Liaison, Rilamore University Office of Communications\n#####\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nContact: Manny Green, mgreen@rhba.com\nRED HILLS (May 25)-The Red Hills Business Association is shifting the dates of its much-anticipated Lunch Hour Concert Series. Normally presented each Thursday in June, the four free concerts will instead take place each Thursday in July. The lineup of artists remains unchanged the Jaystone Jazz Trio will open the series on July 4, followed on successive Thursdays by Joss and the Jaybirds, Ray Starform, and the Barklay Bass Quintet.\n\nAs usual, all three blocks of Oak Street will be closed to traffic, restaurants will serve lunch at outdoor tables, and local arts-and-crafts vendors will display their work on the lawn of the Cultural Center. It is a beautiful celebration in the heart of a popular Red Hills neighborhood. We hope to see you there!",

I am considering replacing the entire roof as it is over 30 years old, and water has begun to drip through the section over the patio. I would appreciate talking to someone who could tell me my options and provide an estimate.\n#####\nNeighborhood Reviews: Lawal Home Service\n★★★★★\n\"I was very pleased with the thoroughness of their work.\"\n\nI left a description of my problem with Lawal Home Service, and one of the company's estimators came to inspect my roof the very next day. After I decided to replace the roof, the Lawal Home Service crew was able to get to work the following week. Diana Perez was on-site for the whole job as promised and answered all my questions. Work was started on December 19, and it was finished on December 20. Once the roofing was finished, the crew did a great job cleaning up. They used two magnetic devices resembling lawnmowers and swept over my entire lawn to find any dropped roofing nails. I had never seen anything like that! I was very pleased with the thoroughness of their work.\n\nDrew Gerson, Inglewood, CA",

Unfortunately, I was not able to include one of the designs for your approval because it needed a late-stage change to the background color. The sticker art did not show up well against the original black background. We are testing a light-beige color, and I will send the updated sample cover to you after it has been approved internally. I should have the last sample to you by the end of this week.\n\nAs long as you send your approval of all covers by June 11, we will be able to ship your entire order of bound notebooks before July 20. You will have everything before your sale that begins on August 1.

Here are the nominees.\n\nErica Boyd has been with us for only a few months but has already shown great promise and is eager to learn new things.\nLauren Almahdi is very proactive. If something needs to be done, she will point it out to a manager and volunteer to take care of it herself.\nNick Salehi found a glitch in our computer system and stopped us from incorrectly ordering unnecessary inventory (thus saving us money).\nMax Rhodes has been especially helpful with training new hires. He is calm and patient and explains our procedures well.\n\nPlease respond to this e-mail by Friday with your vote. The winner must receive at least three votes. The winner will be posted at our front desk and on our Web site next Monday.\n\nThanks,\nCharlotte Black\nGeneral Manager, Wilson Autos\n#####\nhttps://www.westchesterreviews.com\nWilson Autos (Westchester)\n★★★★★\n\nMy wife and I just bought a new Excelera truck at the Wilson Autos Westchester location with the help of Erica Boyd. Even though she was new, she was very knowledgeable about all the trucks on the lot that we wanted to test drive. The few questions she was unable to answer were quickly addressed by her mentor, Max. We were very pleased with the customer service and even more delighted when the general manager agreed to sell us the Excelera for the same price that a competing dealership was advertising. I highly recommend Wilson Autos if you are in the market for a new vehicle!\n\n-Henry Riggs, August 22\n#####\nThe employee of the month for September is ERICA BOYD!\n\nIn her three months at Wilson Autos, Erica has picked up new skills quickly and is always trying to learn more. She has become very knowledgeable about our inventory and is able to share her knowledge with customers to complete sales. She has also been instrumental in encouraging satisfied customers to post comments on our social media pages. We received more great reviews in the past month than we did in the four previous months combined! Erica has received a $50 gift card to Alonzo's Restaurant as a thank-you for her excellent work. Congratulations, Erica!",
